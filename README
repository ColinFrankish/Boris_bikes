This is a sample Boris Bikes project. 

Overview. 

Similar to the 'Boris Bikes' scheme used in London. 

Aim is to devise Ruby classes to interact and control the distribution of bikes, getting them fixed when broken. 

Bikes must be able to break and to be fixed in garages. 

Bike docking stations must know when they are full and if there are any broken bikes in there. 

Vans are used to collect broken bikes and take them to garages to be fixed, and fixed bikes must collected by the vans and taken to the docking stations. 

There must be a capacity for the station,van and garage. 

This project is using pure Ruby code, to practise using classes, methods etc. 

This project is fully TDD driven using Rspec.
